## Bluescope unveils ‘world first’ solar roof with heat and power

1. A small terrace house in inner Sydney is hosting what is  
2. believed to be the world’s first building-integrated solar  
3. system that generates electricity as well as heat.  

4. The array combines thin-film solar PV and solar thermal  
5. technologies into a steel sheet roofing product produced  
6. by Australian steel manufacturer Bluescope, with  
7. assistance from the Australian Renewable Energy  
8. Agency (ARENA).  

9. The top layer of the roofing product generates electricity  
10. in the same way as solar PV modules – although it uses  
11. thin film technology for less weight and thickness –  
12. while heat is trapped and distributed between the two  
13. layers for use in water and space heating.  

14. The BIPVT (building-integrated photovoltaic and  
15. thermal) installation is being hailed as a product that  
16. could one day be sold on rooftops, although Bluescope  
17. is quick to point out that won’t be anytime soon. More  
18. work needs to be done in understanding supply chains  
19. and manufacturing costs before it is launched on the  
20. market.  

21. “Today we are witnessing an exciting new technology  
22. solution moving from the lab to be prototyped on  
23. everyday Australian rooftops for the first time,” ARENA  
24. CEO Ivor Frischknecht said in a statement.  

25. “The old corrugated steel roof on this house has been  
26. completely replaced with the first integrated photovoltaic  
27. (PV) thermal system in Australia, generating reliable  
28. renewable energy for the residents.  

29. In addition to PV panels, an innovative thermal duct  
30. system warms and cools air to supplement air  
31. conditioning in the homes. These first installations are  
32. an important step as the technology moves towards  
33. commercialisation and cost competitiveness with  
34. conventional rooftop PV.”  

35. Bluescope is trying to reduce costs through improved  
36. PV modules and roofing designs, reduced packaging  
37. and transport, improved building energy efficiency and  
38. easy, low-cost installation.  

39. It could also be used in retrofits. A new roof deck above  
40. the existing roof surface can incorporate solar cells, and  
41. air then flows in the duct created under the new roof  
42. surface. This air flow will not only help cool the solar  
43. cells during warm weather, improving generation  
44. efficiency, but it will also help to heat and cool the  
45. building. Warm air generated in winter is used for  
46. heating, and as heat is radiated from the cells on summer  
47. nights, cool air is then supplied to the building,  
48. increasing overall energy efficiency.  

49. Bluescope sees this technology being applicable in the  
50. residential, commercial and industrial markets.

## Daniella's Presentation Preparation – Bluescope Roofing System

### 1. List the different functions of the new Bluescope roofing material.

- It generates electricity 
- It captures and distributes heat 
- heat and cool indoor air.  

---

### 2. Compare the system with conventional photovoltaic panels.

- generates electricity in the same way as solar PV modules – although it uses thin film technology for less weight and thickness

---

### 3. Describe the benefits of retrofitting older homes with this system.

- A new roof deck above the existing roof surface can incorporate solar cells, and air then flows in the duct created under the new roof surface

- This air flow will not only help cool the solar cells during warm weather, improving generation efficiency, but it will also help to heat and cool the building
 
---

### 4. Assess whether the trial will lead quickly to a full commercial launch.

- More work needs to be done in understanding supply chains and manufacturing costs before it is launched on the market
